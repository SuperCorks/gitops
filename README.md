Safely promote changes from develop to main using fast-forward-only merges to maintain a clean Git history.

## Installation

### Using npx

You can use this tool without installing it via npx:

```bash
npx @supercorks/git-promote@latest
```

### Setting up a Git Alias

For convenient access, you can set up a Git alias to run the command:

```bash
# Add the alias to your global Git config
git config --global alias.promote '!npx @supercorks/git-promote'
```

Then you can simply use:

```bash
git promote
```
